%INPUTS:    Z:          The square or rectangular subregion of the image to  
%        be fit, with each element giving the value of one  
%        pixel.  
%           X:          This matrix or vector should be the same size as 
%                       z, with each element giving the x-coordinate of 
%                       the corresponding pixel.  
%           Y:          This matrix or vector should be the same size as 
%                       z, with each element giving the y-coordinate of 
%                       the corresponding pixel.  
%           NOISELEVEL: The standard deviation of the background noise.  
% 
%OUTPUTS:   XC,YC:      The center of the Gaussian in x and y 
%           WX:         The width of the Gaussian, in the X direction 
%           WY:         The width of the Gaussian, in the Y direction 
%           A:          The amplitude of the Gaussian.  
  
%For elliptical Gaussians, if z is a square region around the brightest  
%pixel, then only a rectangular sub-region contains significant signal if  
%the widths are not identical. Apply a first pass, excluding rows and 
%columns which do not contain signal.  
cols=find(mean(z,1)>4*noiselevel/sqrt(size(z,2))); 
rows=find(mean(z,2)>4*noiselevel/sqrt(size(z,1))); 
  
%Extract the relevant portions 
z=z(rows,cols); 
x=x(rows,cols); 
y=y(rows,cols); 
  
%Convert to column form, if it wasn't already 
x=x(:); y=y(:); 
Z=z(:)+1e-15; 
%The miniscule offset on Z has no significant effect, but is a shortcut to 
%ensure that no element of Z equals 0. The probability that an element of 
%z equals 0 is not insignificant (as we may be working with integers, the 
%probability than an element equals exactly -1e-15 is negligible.  
  
%Compute the weighting. This is approximate, as we are working in the log 
%scale, where the noise will be asymmetric. Bounds were placed on this to 
%avoid logs of negative numbers, but for any case the bound triggers, the 
%weight will be quite low anyway.  
noise=log(max(Z+noiselevel,1e-10))-log(max(Z-noiselevel,1e-20)); 
wght=(1./noise); 
  
%Apply a threshold, to exclude points where the signal-to-noise ratio is 
%too low to contribute usefully 
wght(Z<=noiselevel)=0; 
  
  
n=[ones(size(x)) x x.^2 y y.^2].*(wght*ones(1,5)); 
d=log(Z).*wght; 
a=n\d; 
%In the least squares sense, a was selected such that  
%   n*a = d 
%or the best possible match thereof.
