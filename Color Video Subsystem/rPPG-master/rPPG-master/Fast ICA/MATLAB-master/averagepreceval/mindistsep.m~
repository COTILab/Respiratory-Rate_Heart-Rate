function [md,mA,mB]=mindistsep(A,B)
% Computes the unique minimum distance of points from A to B. To each point
% A it finds the closest point B. 
% It is not ideal as in situation like this: o   xo x it does not performs
% optimally. But that is life. (It works under suggestion that the
% estimated points are close to the true ones.
